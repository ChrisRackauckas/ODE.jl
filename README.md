Various basic Ordinary Differential Equation solvers

Some of these solvers are known to be produce incorrect results. More
verification and codes are necessary.

Pull requests are always highly welcome to fix bugs, add solvers, or
anything else!

Also see the Sundials.jl package, which provides wrappers for the excellent
Sundials ODE solver library.
